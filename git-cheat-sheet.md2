Git Cheat Sheet
Link Github to Local Project:
git remote add origin <Link from GitHub>
To check if the link was successful:

git remote -v
Push the changes to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Put your message here"
git push origin master
Get Updates from GitHub Repo:
Go to the repo called LearnToCode-FullRepo-Solutions
Open Terminal
git pull origin master
Clone an existing GitHub Repo:
We go to the directory that we want to have the folder in
Open the terminal
git clone <Link from Github>
Remember to replace <Link from Github> with the actual GitHub link you want to use.

These commands can help you manage your local repository and synchronize it with the remote GitHub repository. They are especially useful when working collaboratively on a project or when you want to keep a backup of your work on a remote server.
